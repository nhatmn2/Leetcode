    "## Solution:\n",
    "To solve this problem, we aim to maintain a doubly-linked list where each node represents a unique count and stores the keys (strings) with that count. The nodes of the list are kept in sorted order, that is, in increasing order of the counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the underlying intuition behind the data structure and its operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using a Doubly Linked List: This allows easy insertion and deletion of nodes which represent counts of keys. A node can quickly connect to its neighbors without having to shift elements, as would be necessary in an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maintaining a root Node: The root node acts as a sentinel that enables the list to be circular, which simplifies the edge cases for insertions and deletions at the beginning and end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Storing Keys in Sets within Nodes: Each node contains a set of keys with the corresponding count for that node. Using a set ensures that we handle the keys efficiently when incrementing and decrementing their counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hashtable to Store References to Nodes: A hashtable (nodes dictionary in Python code) keeps track of the nodes associated with each key. This enables constant-time access to the nodes when incrementing or decrementing counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increment (inc): When a key's count is incremented:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the key is new, it is either added to a new node with count 1 or to an existing node if it directly follows the root node with a count of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the key already exists in a node, we either create a new node with an incremented count right after the current node (if the incremented count does not match the next node's count) or we add the key to the set of the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decrement (dec): When a key's count is decremented:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the count comes down to 0, the key is removed from the hashtable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the key's count after decrementing doesn't match the previous node's count (or no previous node exists), a new node is created with the decremented count. Otherwise, the key is added to the previous node's set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get Maximum (getMaxKey) and Get Minimum (getMinKey): To retrieve the keys with maximum and minimum counts, we can directly access the sets in the last and first nodes, respectively, from the root due to the order maintained in the doubly-linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "By carefully maintaining the structure of the linked list and the hashtable, we can achieve the required constant average time complexity for each operation mandated by the problem.\n",
